### Prediction 


# Speration Train/Test set 

```{r}
library(caret)
intrain <- createDataPartition(y=dataset$show_up, p=0.7, list=FALSE)
df.train <- dataset[intrain, ]
df.test <- dataset[-intrain, ]
```

# Imbalanced classes
Our dataset is imbalanced and we need to keep that in mind when thryng to predict the number of no-shows. 

```{r}
sum(dataset$show_up==1)/nrow(dataset)*100
```

69.70% of the patients do show up. As a result, a model which has an accuracy rate lower than this rate doesn't imporve anything. Prediciting a show for each patient would have a better accuracy rate.  

How to work with an imbalanced dataset? Here the ratio is 70:30   
First, we can hilight the fact that the imbalanceness of our dataset is totally normal and was expected.  

Accurcay - Accuracy Paradix
FAlse Positive - False NEgative
